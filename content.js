        <h3 id="main-content-first-title">From Placing Blocks to Writing Logic: My Journey in Tech.</h3>
        <h4>Hello! I'm Vithujan Sooriyaruban.</h4>
        <p class="main-text">It didn't start with a line of code. It started with a block.</p>
        <p class="main-text">Five years ago, like many, I was exploring the infinite worlds of <strong>Minecraft</strong>. But while others were just playing, I became obsessed with the mechanics behind the game. I wanted to understand <em>how</em> it worked, <em>why</em> it reacted the way it did, and how I could manipulate the logic to create something new. That curiosity was the spark that turned a hobby into a calling.</p>
        <p class="main-text">Fast forward to today, based in <strong>Paris</strong>, I have just completed my <strong>Bachelor's degree in Computer Science</strong>. That initial spark has evolved into a disciplined passion for problem-solving and digital architecture.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>How I Work: The Intersection of Intuition and Method</h4>
        <p class="main-text">I believe the best code comes from a balance of creativity and rigor. My approach is <strong>intuitive</strong> when brainstorming solutions, but strictly <strong>methodical</strong> when executing them. Whether I am untangling a complex algorithm in C or designing a smooth user experience in React, I rely on adaptability and discipline to get the job done right.</p>
        <p class="main-text">I am driven by discovery. Currently, I am exploring different horizons—from the intricacies of <strong>AI & Machine Learning</strong> to the robustness of <strong>Cybersecurity</strong>—before narrowing my focus for my upcoming Master's degree.</p>
        <h4>My Technical Arsenal</h4>
        <p class="main-text">Over the years, I have built a versatile toolkit that allows me to work across the full stack:</p>
        <ul class="main-list">
            <li><strong>Languages:</strong> I am fluent in the classics and the moderns, including <strong>Java, Python, C, Scala, OCaml,</strong> and the full web stack (<strong>HTML/CSS/JS/PHP</strong>).</li>
            <li><strong>Development & Frameworks:</strong> I love building responsive applications using <strong>React, React Native, Express.js,</strong> and <strong>Laravel</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Data & Intelligence:</strong> I manage data with <strong>SQL (MySQL, SQLite)</strong> and <strong>MongoDB</strong>, and I am currently diving into <strong>Machine Learning with SKLearn</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Infrastructure & Security:</strong> Understanding the network is key. I have skills in <strong>Cryptography, Cisco Meraki, Active Directory,</strong> and <strong>Linux (Ubuntu)</strong> environments.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h4>What's Next?</h4>
        <p class="main-text">My portfolio is not just a showcase of what I have done, it is a live documentation of what I am learning. While I have a dedicated page for my projects (which I highly recommend you check out!), this space is about the person behind the keyboard.</p>
        <p class="main-text">I am always open to discussing technology, potential collaborations, or simply the future of IT. If you want to talk code, logic, or even Minecraft, feel free to reach out.</p>

    <h2 id="main-title">Projects — My Journey Through Code and Creativity</h2>
        <div id="main-content">
            <p class="main-text">Every project has a story. Every line of code has a purpose. And behind every finished application or model, there’s a moment of curiosity, struggle, and discovery that defines the journey.</p>
            <p class="main-text">In this section, I invite you to explore two projects that mark significant milestones in my learning and experimentation with technology. Both are very different, but both share the same core: my curiosity and determination to understand how things work.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Project 1: Understanding the Invisible — My First Real Dive into AI & Machine Learning</h3>
            <p class="main-text">Have you ever seen AI everywhere, heard everyone talk about it, but felt like nobody really explained it? That was me. I decided to take matters into my own hands and do a full machine learning project on my own. I scraped data from scratch, cleaned messy datasets, handled Parisian districts, and finally trained models to see the magic behind <code>.fit()</code>. It wasn’t just about building AI—it was about understanding it deeply, step by step.</p>

            <h3>Project 2: Decoding the Silence — Building an Intelligent SQL Injection Scanner</h3>
            <p class="main-text">Have you ever wondered how a hacker "sees" a vulnerability when the server remains completely silent? I wanted to go beyond the basics, so I built a professional-grade automated scanner from scratch. I engineered a recursive crawler to map attack surfaces, implemented blind detection engines using differential size analysis, and mastered the math behind time-based injections to account for network jitter. It wasn’t just about finding bugs—it was about mastering the invisible logic of cybersecurity and building a tool that thinks like a pentester.</p>

            <p class="main-text">Both projects reflect my journey: one into the invisible world of AI, the other into the tangible world of mobile apps. Different challenges, different technologies, same curiosity driving me forward. Take a look, get inspired, and maybe find a spark for your own adventure.</p>

    <h2 id="main-title">Understanding the Invisible: My First Real Dive into Data & Machine Learning</h2>
	<div id="main-content">
		<p class="main-text">Have you ever tried to understand something that everyone talks about… but nobody really explains? For me, that “something” was <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>.</p>
        <p class="main-text">I kept hearing this word everywhere: <em>Artificial Intelligence</em>. On YouTube. At university. In conversations between people who pretended to understand it.</p>
        <p class="main-text">And the more I heard it, the more I felt a strange mix of fascination and frustration. Everyone talked about AI like it was magic. Nobody explained how it actually worked.</p>
        <p class="main-text">One evening, after watching yet another video where someone built “an AI in 10 minutes”, I asked myself:</p>
        <p class="main-text"><strong>“Is it really that simple? Just run 'model.fit()' and… voilà?”</strong></p>
        <p class="main-text">That question stayed in my head. And without realizing it, it pushed me into my very first real machine learning project.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Act I — The Assignment That Became Something Else</h2>
        <p class="main-text">It started as a simple university project — Semester 6, last stretch of my bachelor's degree. We were supposed to work in pairs. My partner dropped out early on.</p>
        <p class="main-text">Suddenly, I was alone with a blank file, a vague topic, and the lingering question:</p>
        <p class="main-text"><strong>“If I do this myself… will I finally understand how AI works?”</strong></p>
        <p class="main-text">So I said yes to the challenge. Not because I was ready, but because I was curious.</p>
        <p class="main-text">Looking back now, that decision changed everything.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Act II — The Hunt for Data</h2>
        <p class="main-text">People imagine AI begins with algorithms. It doesn't. It begins with <strong>data</strong>.</p>
        <p class="main-text">Except… I didn't have any.</p>
        <p class="main-text">No clean CSV. No prepared dataset. Just a real estate website and a requirement:</p>
        <p class="main-text"><strong>“Collect everything yourself.”</strong></p>
        <p class="main-text">What followed felt like digital archaeology.</p>
        <p class="main-text">I wrote a scraper. Then rewrote it. Then fixed it, broke it, fixed it again, and watched it break for a completely different reason.</p>
        <p class="main-text">Multi-page navigation turned into a labyrinth. Announcements disappeared, duplicated, or came with missing fields. I had to invent my own rules — little exceptions and warnings to prevent everything from collapsing.</p>
        <p class="main-text">Some days, I swear the website was laughing at me.</p>
        <p class="main-text">But the truth is… I loved it. There was something strangely satisfying about digging through HTML tags, cleaning weird price formats, and catching errors before they exploded.</p>
        <p class="main-text">It felt like discovering treasure — one broken page at a time.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Act III — The Chaos No One Warns You About</h2>
        <p class="main-text">When I finally obtained my precious dataset, I opened it expecting relief.</p>
        <p class="main-text">Instead, I found chaos.</p>
        <p class="main-text">Accents everywhere. Cities with ten different spellings. Surfaces missing. DPE values inconsistent. Paris districts written like “1er”, “1e”, “1eme”, “1ER”, or simply “Paris”.</p>
        <p class="main-text">It was like someone had taken a good dataset, shaken it violently, and thrown it into a blender.</p>
        <p class="main-text">This was the moment I realized something fundamental:</p>
        <p class="main-text"><strong>Machine Learning doesn't start with models. It starts with cleaning.</strong></p>
        <p class="main-text">I spent hours repairing names, replacing values, merging the dataset with official city information, and catching edge cases I didn't even know existed.</p>
        <p class="main-text">At some point, I found myself arguing with my computer over a misplaced accent on “Brières-les-Scellés”.</p>
        <p class="main-text">Yes. I argued with an accent.</p>
        <p class="main-text">That's how I knew I was becoming a real data person.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Act IV — Teaching a Machine to Think (Sort Of)</h2>
        <p class="main-text">Once the data was clean — finally — I trained my first models.</p>
        <p class="main-text">I tried:</p>
        <ul class="main-list">
            <li>Linear Regression</li>
            <li>Decision Trees</li>
            <li>K-Nearest Neighbors</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="main-text">I scaled, normalized, tested, compared. I plotted heatmaps. I checked correlations. I did PCA just because I wanted to see what would happen.</p>
        <p class="main-text">It was the first time I saw numbers turn into predictions. Not perfect ones. Not magical ones. But real ones.</p>
        <p class="main-text">And in that moment, I understood something most tutorials never say out loud:</p>
        <p class="main-text"><strong>Building an AI is easy. Understanding it is a journey.</strong></p>
        <p class="main-text">And this project was the beginning of mine.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Act V — What I Didn't Expect to Learn</h2>
        <p class="main-text">This project didn't just teach me tools. It taught me perspectives.</p>
        <ul class="main-list">
            <li>That the “invisible” part of AI — the data, the cleaning, the preprocessing — is where the real intelligence lies.</li>
            <li>That curiosity is more powerful than skills.</li>
            <li>That working alone forces you to grow.</li>
            <li>That understanding something deeply is far more rewarding than simply making it work.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="main-text">It also made me realize something surprising:</p>
        <p class="main-text">I had built a model. I had cleaned a dataset. I had scraped a website. But above all—</p>
        <p class="main-text"><strong>I had finally understood what was happening behind that innocent-looking .fit() line.</strong></p>
        <p class="main-text">And that changed my entire relationship with AI.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Epilogue — Why This Story Matters</h2>
        <p class="main-text">Maybe you're into tech. Maybe you're not. Maybe you're a PhD researcher, a cashier, a developer, or someone who has never written a line of code.</p>
        <p class="main-text">It doesn't matter.</p>
        <p class="main-text">Because this story isn't about programming. It's about starting something you don't understand — and choosing to understand it anyway.</p>
        <p class="main-text">If you've ever looked at a field from the outside and thought <em>“That looks complicated…”</em>, let this be a reminder:</p>
        <p class="main-text"><strong>Everything looks complicated until you start scratching the surface.</strong></p>
        <p class="main-text">That's what this project was for me: a scratch on the surface of something bigger. A first dive into the invisible. And the moment I realized I wanted to go much deeper.</p>

    <h2 id="main-title">Decoding the Silence: Building a Professional SQL Injection Scanner from Scratch</h2>
        <div id="main-content">
            <p class="main-text">Have you ever wondered how security experts actually "see" a vulnerability? For a long time, <strong>SQL Injection</strong> was just a term I heard in YouTube videos—a mysterious flaw where a single quote could topple a database.</p>
            <p class="main-text">I kept seeing the same tutorials: "Just put a <em>'</em> and see if it breaks." But as a developer, that wasn't enough for me. I wanted to know: <em>How can a machine detect a flaw when the server remains silent?</em></p>
            <p class="main-text">That curiosity turned into a months-long journey of building a full-scale automated scanner. Not just a script, but a "brain" that thinks like a pentester.</p>
            <hr>
            
            <h3>Act I — Mapping the Labyrinth</h3>
            <p class="main-text">An automated attack doesn't start with a payload. It starts with <strong>visibility</strong>. If you can't see the door, you can't check the lock.</p>
            <p class="main-text">I spent weeks building the <strong>Crawler</strong>. It felt like teaching a robot to navigate a maze. It had to find every link, every hidden form, and every API endpoint without getting stuck in infinite loops.</p>
            <p class="main-text">Watching my terminal discover 50+ entry points in seconds was my first "Eureka" moment. I had mapped the attack surface; now, the real challenge began.</p>
            <hr>

            <h3>Act II — The 1% Difference</h3>
            <p class="main-text">The biggest myth in cybersecurity is that a hack always results in a big "Error 500" message. In the real world, servers are often <strong>Blind</strong>. They don't tell you what happened.</p>
            <p class="main-text">I had to implement <strong>Boolean-Based analysis</strong>. This is where it got mathematical. My scanner had to compare the "Baseline" (the normal page) with the "True" response at a byte-level.</p>
            <p class="main-text"><strong>"Is a 1.2% difference in page size a proof of a vulnerability or just a dynamic ad changing?"</strong></p>
            <p class="main-text">I had to write algorithms to filter out the noise. I learned that data is messy, and security is often about finding a needle of logic in a haystack of random HTML changes.</p>
            <hr>

            <h3>Act III — Racing Against the Clock</h3>
            <p class="main-text">Then came the hardest part: <strong>Time-Based Injections</strong>. When the server doesn't send a different page, you have to make it "talk" through time.</p>
            <p class="main-text">I told the server: <em>"If the database name starts with 'A', wait for 5 seconds."</em></p>
            <p class="main-text">But the internet is unpredictable. A slow Wi-Fi could look like a vulnerability. I had to build a detection engine that calculates a <strong>dynamic baseline</strong> and uses a 90% confidence threshold to verify the delay.</p>
            <p class="main-text">When I saw my scanner pause for exactly 5 seconds, then 2 seconds for confirmation, I knew I hadn't just built a tool—I had built a precision instrument.</p>
            <hr>

            <h3>Act IV — The Invisible Shield</h3>
            <p class="main-text">During my tests, I hit a wall: <strong>WAFs (Web Application Firewalls)</strong>. They blocked my payloads and gave me "403 Forbidden" errors.</p>
            <p class="main-text">Instead of giving up, I coded a detection module. My scanner learned to recognize when it was being watched. It adjusted its aggressiveness, modified its payloads, and learned to "whisper" instead of "scream."</p>
            <p class="main-text">This taught me the most important lesson in software: <strong>Robustness comes from handling the "No," not just the "Yes."</strong></p>
            <hr>

            <h3>Act V — Beyond the Code</h2>
            <p class="main-text">This project changed my perspective on development. I used to build features; now I build systems that defend themselves.</p>
            <ul class="main-list">
                <li><strong>Precision over Power:</strong> It's easy to crash a server; it's hard to analyze it without leaving a trace.</li>
                <li><strong>The Beauty of Logic:</strong> SQLi isn't just a bug; it's a failure of logic that can be found through math and observation.</li>
                <li><strong>Empathy for Security:</strong> I now understand why security teams are so meticulous. One unvalidated parameter is all it takes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="main-text">Today, this scanner is more than a line in my GitHub. It’s the proof that I can take a complex, invisible problem and turn it into a structured, automated solution.</p>
