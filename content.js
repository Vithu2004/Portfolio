        <h3 id="main-content-first-title">From Placing Blocks to Writing Logic: My Journey in Tech.</h3>
        <h4>Hello! I'm Vithujan Sooriyaruban.</h4>
        <p class="main-text">It didn't start with a line of code. It started with a block.</p>
        <p class="main-text">Five years ago, like many, I was exploring the infinite worlds of <strong>Minecraft</strong>. But while others were just playing, I became obsessed with the mechanics behind the game. I wanted to understand <em>how</em> it worked, <em>why</em> it reacted the way it did, and how I could manipulate the logic to create something new. That curiosity was the spark that turned a hobby into a calling.</p>
        <p class="main-text">Fast forward to today, based in <strong>Paris</strong>, I have just completed my <strong>Bachelor's degree in Computer Science</strong>. That initial spark has evolved into a disciplined passion for problem-solving and digital architecture.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>How I Work: The Intersection of Intuition and Method</h4>
        <p class="main-text">I believe the best code comes from a balance of creativity and rigor. My approach is <strong>intuitive</strong> when brainstorming solutions, but strictly <strong>methodical</strong> when executing them. Whether I am untangling a complex algorithm in C or designing a smooth user experience in React, I rely on adaptability and discipline to get the job done right.</p>
        <p class="main-text">I am driven by discovery. Currently, I am exploring different horizons—from the intricacies of <strong>AI & Machine Learning</strong> to the robustness of <strong>Cybersecurity</strong>—before narrowing my focus for my upcoming Master's degree.</p>
        <h4>My Technical Arsenal</h4>
        <p class="main-text">Over the years, I have built a versatile toolkit that allows me to work across the full stack:</p>
        <ul class="main-list">
            <li><strong>Languages:</strong> I am fluent in the classics and the moderns, including <strong>Java, Python, C, Scala, OCaml,</strong> and the full web stack (<strong>HTML/CSS/JS/PHP</strong>).</li>
            <li><strong>Development & Frameworks:</strong> I love building responsive applications using <strong>React, React Native, Express.js,</strong> and <strong>Laravel</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Data & Intelligence:</strong> I manage data with <strong>SQL (MySQL, SQLite)</strong> and <strong>MongoDB</strong>, and I am currently diving into <strong>Machine Learning with SKLearn</strong>.</li>
            <li><strong>Infrastructure & Security:</strong> Understanding the network is key. I have skills in <strong>Cryptography, Cisco Meraki, Active Directory,</strong> and <strong>Linux (Ubuntu)</strong> environments.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h4>What's Next?</h4>
        <p class="main-text">My portfolio is not just a showcase of what I have done, it is a live documentation of what I am learning. While I have a dedicated page for my projects (which I highly recommend you check out!), this space is about the person behind the keyboard.</p>
        <p class="main-text">I am always open to discussing technology, potential collaborations, or simply the future of IT. If you want to talk code, logic, or even Minecraft, feel free to reach out.</p>

    <h2 id="main-title">Projects — My Journey Through Code and Creativity</h2>
        <div id="main-content">
            <p class="main-text">Every project has a story. Every line of code has a purpose. And behind every finished application or model, there’s a moment of curiosity, struggle, and discovery that defines the journey.</p>
            <p class="main-text">In this section, I invite you to explore two projects that mark significant milestones in my learning and experimentation with technology. Both are very different, but both share the same core: my curiosity and determination to understand how things work.</p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Project 1: Understanding the Invisible — My First Real Dive into AI & Machine Learning</h3>
            <p class="main-text">Have you ever seen AI everywhere, heard everyone talk about it, but felt like nobody really explained it? That was me. I decided to take matters into my own hands and do a full machine learning project on my own. I scraped data from scratch, cleaned messy datasets, handled Parisian districts, and finally trained models to see the magic behind <code>.fit()</code>. It wasn’t just about building AI—it was about understanding it deeply, step by step.</p>

            <h3>Project 2: DailyMood Journaling App — Bringing Your Mood to Life on Android</h3>
            <p class="main-text">Curious about Android development, I challenged myself to create a personal journaling app. Every day, users can summarize their mood in three words—optimism, joy, sadness—and navigate through a fully functional calendar. From designing the UI to managing data and building the logic, I developed every part of the app myself. It was my first real taste of mobile development and even included the thrill of publishing it.</p>

            <hr>
            <p class="main-text">Both projects reflect my journey: one into the invisible world of AI, the other into the tangible world of mobile apps. Different challenges, different technologies, same curiosity driving me forward. Take a look, get inspired, and maybe find a spark for your own adventure.</p>

    <h2 id="main-title">Understanding the Invisible: My First Real Dive into Data & Machine Learning</h2>
	<div id="main-content">
		<p class="main-text">Have you ever tried to understand something that everyone talks about… but nobody really explains? For me, that “something” was <strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong>.</p>
        <p class="main-text">I kept hearing this word everywhere: <em>Artificial Intelligence</em>. On YouTube. At university. In conversations between people who pretended to understand it.</p>
        <p class="main-text">And the more I heard it, the more I felt a strange mix of fascination and frustration. Everyone talked about AI like it was magic. Nobody explained how it actually worked.</p>
        <p class="main-text">One evening, after watching yet another video where someone built “an AI in 10 minutes”, I asked myself:</p>
        <p class="main-text"><strong>“Is it really that simple? Just run 'model.fit()' and… voilà?”</strong></p>
        <p class="main-text">That question stayed in my head. And without realizing it, it pushed me into my very first real machine learning project.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Act I — The Assignment That Became Something Else</h2>
        <p class="main-text">It started as a simple university project — Semester 6, last stretch of my bachelor's degree. We were supposed to work in pairs. My partner dropped out early on.</p>
        <p class="main-text">Suddenly, I was alone with a blank file, a vague topic, and the lingering question:</p>
        <p class="main-text"><strong>“If I do this myself… will I finally understand how AI works?”</strong></p>
        <p class="main-text">So I said yes to the challenge. Not because I was ready, but because I was curious.</p>
        <p class="main-text">Looking back now, that decision changed everything.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Act II — The Hunt for Data</h2>
        <p class="main-text">People imagine AI begins with algorithms. It doesn't. It begins with <strong>data</strong>.</p>
        <p class="main-text">Except… I didn't have any.</p>
        <p class="main-text">No clean CSV. No prepared dataset. Just a real estate website and a requirement:</p>
        <p class="main-text"><strong>“Collect everything yourself.”</strong></p>
        <p class="main-text">What followed felt like digital archaeology.</p>
        <p class="main-text">I wrote a scraper. Then rewrote it. Then fixed it, broke it, fixed it again, and watched it break for a completely different reason.</p>
        <p class="main-text">Multi-page navigation turned into a labyrinth. Announcements disappeared, duplicated, or came with missing fields. I had to invent my own rules — little exceptions and warnings to prevent everything from collapsing.</p>
        <p class="main-text">Some days, I swear the website was laughing at me.</p>
        <p class="main-text">But the truth is… I loved it. There was something strangely satisfying about digging through HTML tags, cleaning weird price formats, and catching errors before they exploded.</p>
        <p class="main-text">It felt like discovering treasure — one broken page at a time.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Act III — The Chaos No One Warns You About</h2>
        <p class="main-text">When I finally obtained my precious dataset, I opened it expecting relief.</p>
        <p class="main-text">Instead, I found chaos.</p>
        <p class="main-text">Accents everywhere. Cities with ten different spellings. Surfaces missing. DPE values inconsistent. Paris districts written like “1er”, “1e”, “1eme”, “1ER”, or simply “Paris”.</p>
        <p class="main-text">It was like someone had taken a good dataset, shaken it violently, and thrown it into a blender.</p>
        <p class="main-text">This was the moment I realized something fundamental:</p>
        <p class="main-text"><strong>Machine Learning doesn't start with models. It starts with cleaning.</strong></p>
        <p class="main-text">I spent hours repairing names, replacing values, merging the dataset with official city information, and catching edge cases I didn't even know existed.</p>
        <p class="main-text">At some point, I found myself arguing with my computer over a misplaced accent on “Brières-les-Scellés”.</p>
        <p class="main-text">Yes. I argued with an accent.</p>
        <p class="main-text">That's how I knew I was becoming a real data person.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Act IV — Teaching a Machine to Think (Sort Of)</h2>
        <p class="main-text">Once the data was clean — finally — I trained my first models.</p>
        <p class="main-text">I tried:</p>
        <ul class="main-list">
            <li>Linear Regression</li>
            <li>Decision Trees</li>
            <li>K-Nearest Neighbors</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="main-text">I scaled, normalized, tested, compared. I plotted heatmaps. I checked correlations. I did PCA just because I wanted to see what would happen.</p>
        <p class="main-text">It was the first time I saw numbers turn into predictions. Not perfect ones. Not magical ones. But real ones.</p>
        <p class="main-text">And in that moment, I understood something most tutorials never say out loud:</p>
        <p class="main-text"><strong>Building an AI is easy. Understanding it is a journey.</strong></p>
        <p class="main-text">And this project was the beginning of mine.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Act V — What I Didn't Expect to Learn</h2>
        <p class="main-text">This project didn't just teach me tools. It taught me perspectives.</p>
        <ul class="main-list">
            <li>That the “invisible” part of AI — the data, the cleaning, the preprocessing — is where the real intelligence lies.</li>
            <li>That curiosity is more powerful than skills.</li>
            <li>That working alone forces you to grow.</li>
            <li>That understanding something deeply is far more rewarding than simply making it work.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="main-text">It also made me realize something surprising:</p>
        <p class="main-text">I had built a model. I had cleaned a dataset. I had scraped a website. But above all—</p>
        <p class="main-text"><strong>I had finally understood what was happening behind that innocent-looking .fit() line.</strong></p>
        <p class="main-text">And that changed my entire relationship with AI.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Epilogue — Why This Story Matters</h2>
        <p class="main-text">Maybe you're into tech. Maybe you're not. Maybe you're a PhD researcher, a cashier, a developer, or someone who has never written a line of code.</p>
        <p class="main-text">It doesn't matter.</p>
        <p class="main-text">Because this story isn't about programming. It's about starting something you don't understand — and choosing to understand it anyway.</p>
        <p class="main-text">If you've ever looked at a field from the outside and thought <em>“That looks complicated…”</em>, let this be a reminder:</p>
        <p class="main-text"><strong>Everything looks complicated until you start scratching the surface.</strong></p>
        <p class="main-text">That's what this project was for me: a scratch on the surface of something bigger. A first dive into the invisible. And the moment I realized I wanted to go much deeper.</p>

    <h2 id="main-title">Daily Mood: My First Android App Adventure</h2>
    <div id="main-content">
        <p class="main-text">Have you ever wondered what it's like to build something entirely from scratch? To dive into a world you've never explored before? For me, that world was <strong>Android development</strong>.</p>
        <p class="main-text">It all started with a simple idea: what if I could capture my daily mood in just three words? Optimism, joy, sadness — whatever defined my day, all stored in a single app that I could carry in my pocket. I wanted a journal that made sense to me, and I wanted to learn how to make it.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Act I — Stepping into Android Studio</h3>
        <p class="main-text">I had never built a mobile app before. Android Studio was intimidating at first: XML layouts, activities, adapters… a language and structure completely different from my web and Python projects. But curiosity got the better of me. I wanted to see how apps are made, and how to eventually publish one.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Act II — Designing My Own World</h3>
        <p class="main-text">I decided to handle everything myself. From the code that runs the calendar, to the layout of buttons and text fields, to the logic of saving and retrieving moods — every single line was written by me. The goal? An app that felt personal and intuitive.</p>
        <p class="main-text">The calendar became the central piece of the puzzle. Each day needed to display three words summarizing my mood. Navigating months, handling empty days, and keeping everything synchronized felt like solving a giant puzzle. It was challenging, yes, but immensely satisfying when it finally worked.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Act III — The Daily Mood Journey</h3>
        <p class="main-text">The main feature of the app is simple yet powerful: record your mood in three words, every day. Buttons take you to the “Daily Journaling” of today or allow you to freely type your thoughts. Behind the scenes, <strong>SharedPreferences</strong> store everything safely, and the calendar dynamically updates as you go.</p>
        <p class="main-text">Watching my words appear on the calendar, seeing the days fill up, was strangely rewarding. I was not just building an app; I was creating a personal diary that I could interact with every day.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Act IV — Lessons Learned</h3>
        <p class="main-text">This project taught me more than just Android syntax. It showed me what it means to design an experience end-to-end, to think about how people (or myself) will interact with the app, and how even small decisions in UI or data storage matter.</p>
        <p class="main-text">I learned that making an app isn't about fancy features — it's about thoughtful design, careful logic, and attention to detail. And most importantly, it taught me the thrill of building something real that I could hold in my hand.</p>
        <hr>
        <h3>Epilogue — More Than Code</h3>
        <p class="main-text">Maybe you've never coded before. Maybe you've only touched a phone. Maybe you're just curious. That's fine. This story isn't about mastering Android in a day — it's about curiosity, experimentation, and the satisfaction of creating something meaningful from nothing.</p>
        <p class="main-text">For me, <strong>Daily Mood</strong> is more than an app. It's a reminder that learning, trying, and building can be as personal and rewarding as the words we write about our own days.</p>
